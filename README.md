# Framebuffer Text Scale

This project aims to provide an easy way to upscale text on screens, 
that are managed by the [`framebuf.Framebuffer` class](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/framebuf.html).

As this is still work in progress, I strongly advice against using the 
library in its current form!
